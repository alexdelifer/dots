# dots

If all you want to do is install certain configs, use `install.sh`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexdelifer/dots ~/dots
cd ~/dots 
./install.sh bin i3 zsh
```
or

```bash
# install all configs
make install
```

If you're going to use `aconfmgr`, then just use that, the dotfiles are managed in `81-dotfiles.sh`

```bash
# install aconfmgr config
./install.sh aconfmgr

# check config vs running system
make diff

# save running system to aconfmgr
make save

# apply config to running system
make apply
```

You can enable or disable different configs from the `02-config.sh` file.
Use `01-default.sh` as a template.
